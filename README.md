#### To get started with the program, simply run the main function in main.cpp.

When prompted, enter the type of ASCII art you want to generate (Normal, Bold, or 3D) and the string of text to convert. The program will then display the ASCII art in the console.

You can run the program multiple times with different inputs by entering **y** or **Y** when prompted to run again.

## Requirements
This program requires a C++ compiler and standard libraries to compile and run.

## Limitations
The program currently only supports ASCII art in three styles (Normal, Bold, and 3D), and the 3D style is limited to uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z and a-z). The width of the ASCII art is determined by the width of the console and may not work properly on very narrow or very wide consoles.
